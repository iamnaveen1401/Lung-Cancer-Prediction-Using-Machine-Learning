## üéØ Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of lung cancer based on various lifestyle, health, and demographic attributes. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals early.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- `GENDER`: Male or Female  
- `AGE`: Age of the individual  
- `SMOKING`: Smoker (1) or Non-smoker (0)  
- `YELLOW_FINGERS`: Presence of yellow fingers due to smoking  
- `ANXIETY`, `PEER_PRESSURE`, `CHRONIC DISEASE`, `FATIGUE`, `ALLERGY`, `WHEEZING`, `ALCOHOL CONSUMING`, `COUGHING`, `SHORTNESS OF BREATH`, `SWALLOWING DIFFICULTY`, `CHEST PAIN`: Binary indicators of symptoms  
- `LUNG_CANCER`: Target class (YES or NO)

**Target Variable**: `LUNG_CANCER`

## üß∞ Dependencies

Install the following Python packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

You can also use the provided `requirements.txt` file (to be created from the notebook environment).

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

### Basic Exploration:

- Shape of dataset
- Info and data types
- Null value check
- Value counts of target label `LUNG_CANCER`

### Visualizations:

- Countplots for categorical features (e.g., Gender, Smoking)
- Pie chart for lung cancer distribution
- Heatmap showing feature correlation

## üîÑ Data Preprocessing

### Label Encoding

Categorical columns like `GENDER` and `LUNG_CANCER` were label-encoded using `LabelEncoder()` from `sklearn`.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df['GENDER'] = le.fit_transform(df['GENDER'])
df['LUNG_CANCER'] = le.fit_transform(df['LUNG_CANCER'])
```

### Splitting Dataset

Split into features and target:

```python
X = df.drop(columns='LUNG_CANCER')
y = df['LUNG_CANCER']
```

Train/test split:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

---

## ü§ñ Model Building

Trained various classification models:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Each model was trained and tested using scikit-learn‚Äôs implementation.

Example:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## üìà Model Evaluation

### Metrics Used:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

Example:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

print(confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions))
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

### Summary of Results:

| Model                 | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | ~87%     |
| SVM (Linear Kernel)  | ~87%     |
| Decision Tree        | ~86%     |
| Random Forest        | ~86%     |
| KNN                  | ~86%     |

*(Note: These are approximations from notebook outputs. Exact scores depend on your dataset state.)*

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- Logistic Regressiont and  Support Vector Machine  models showed the highest accuracy.
- Features such as Smoking, Yellow Fingers, and Chest Pain had strong correlations with lung cancer diagnosis.
- Machine learning can aid in early lung cancer detection when combined with reliable data.

## üîÆ Future Work

- Use cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Apply hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)
- Explore ensemble stacking techniques
- Integrate model into a web-based application using Streamlit or Flask
